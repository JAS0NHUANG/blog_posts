# Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)
- IaaS
- Rent VMs (EC2)
- Store data (EBS)
- Loadbalancing (ELB)
- Auto-scaling group (ASG)

## EC2 Options
- OS
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage(EBS & EFS, EC2 Instance Store...etc)
- Network card, IP
- Firewall (security group)
- Bootstrap script (EC2 User Data)

## EC2 Instance Type
### Instance naming
m5.2xlarge
- m: type
- 5: generation
- 2xlarge: size

1. General Purpose
2. Compute Optimized(Batch Processing, Media transcode, HPC, Sientific, ML...)
3. Memory Optimized(Hight performence DB, In-memory DB for BI, big unstructured data...)
4. Storage Optimized(OLTP systems, DBs, Cache, Data warehouse, Distributed file system...)

Nice website for AWS services info:
[Vantage](https://instances.vantage.sh/)

## Security Groups
- Act as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
- Access to Ports, IP ranges, control of Inbound/Outbound network
- It can be attached to multiple instances
- By default all inbound traffic is blocked, all outbound traffic is authorazed
- We can reference other security groups(usually for other instances' connection)
- Normaly a "Time Out" connection error is caused by Security Group blockage
- Don't enter IAM info in a EC2 Instance(set up IAM Role instead)

### Classic Ports to know
22(SSH), 21(FTP), 22(SFTP), 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS), 3389(RDP)

## Purchasing Options
1. On-Demand Instances - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
2. Reserved Instances - long workloads, pay by Terms
3. Savings Plans - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
4. Spot Instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances(less reliable)
5. Dedicated Hosts - physical server, control instance placement
6. Dedicated Instances - no hardware sharing with other customers
7. Capacity Reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ
